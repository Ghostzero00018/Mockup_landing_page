# Guerlain_landing_page (By default)

This is a mock-up landing page for the Digital Marketing course. It is mainly used for the new product campaign and the final presentation showcase.

## Mock-up Landing Page Project

Welcome to the Mock-up Landing Page mini-project!

## Recommended Files

If you want to see the landing page as intended, it is **recommended** to use the following files:

- `Landing_page_mk3.html`
- `style3.css`

These files provide the best and most up-to-date version of the landing page design.

And if you want to view the earlier version of the landing page, you can check the following files:

- `Landing_page_backup.html`
- `style_backup.css`

## How to View

1. Download both `Landing_page_mk3.html` and `style3.css`. (**I use VSCode as the platform**)
2. Place them in the same folder/directory.
3. Open `Landing_page_mk3.html` in your web browser.

Youâ€™ll see the latest version (maybe not the latest version by the time you download it) of the mock-up landing page appropriately styled.
